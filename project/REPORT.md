# Software Product Line Optimization 
## Overview

A software product line is a set of software-intensive systems that share a common, managed set of features satisfying the specific needs of a particular market segment or mission and that are developed from a common set of core assets in a prescribed way [1]. They are emerging as an important development paradigm because they help companies in modelling their solutions and offerings. It provides a structured way to quantify market, cost, productivity, quality, and other business drivers. A fundamental problem in software product line engineering is that a product line of industrial size can easily incorporate several thousand variable features. Such variability leads to heterogeneous goals and contradicting requirements. This motivated us to use the optimization techniques studied in CSC 591 Automated Software Engineering for finding sound and optimum configurations of very large variability models.
